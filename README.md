# Big Data Big Heart

Part of what makes Australia great is the way we take care of the most vulnerable people among us.

Calling all changemakers, automation evangelists, big data architects, developers, humanists, students, and artists - 
let's get together to create something greater than the sum of our parts!


Help us empower our Challenge Providers to make a real difference in people's lives.

## Datasets

Here is your one stop shop for the Hackathon Data. By no means is this an exhaustive list of data, you are free to 
connect with any public datasets you can find.

Note well: some of this data has been provided by the challenge providers, and is not currently available elsewhere.

There are two folders of data:

+ ChallengeProvidedData - data from the challenge providers
+ PublicData - data that has been collected for the Hackathon from publically available data sources.

## Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live 
code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical 
simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.


Most of our datasets have jupyter notebooks and panda profiles to help you understand the data better.
